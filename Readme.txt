MELCloud Optimizer for Homey

This app connects your Mitsubishi Electric heat pump (via MELCloud) with Homey and optimizes its operation based on real-time electricity prices from Tibber and weather conditions.

The app automatically adjusts your heat pump's target temperature based on current electricity prices, increasing temperature during cheap hours and decreasing during expensive hours. It also features hot water tank temperature optimization.

The advanced thermal learning model adapts to your home's specific characteristics over time, improving efficiency and comfort while reducing energy costs.
