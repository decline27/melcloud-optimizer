### Architectural Patterns & Design Principles

#### 1. **Layered Architecture**
- **Presentation Layer**: Settings UI, REST API endpoints
- **Application Layer**: Main app coordination, cron job management
- **Business Logic Layer**: Services (Optimizer, ThermalModel, COPHelper)
- **Data Access Layer**: BaseApiService with circuit breakers
- **External Integration Layer**: API clients with resilience patterns

#### 2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CLOSED
    CLOSED --> OPEN : Failure threshold reached
    OPEN --> HALF_OPEN : Reset timeout elapsed
    HALF_OPEN --> CLOSED : Success threshold met
    HALF_OPEN --> OPEN : Failure detected
    
    note right of CLOSED : Normal operation
    note right of OPEN : Fail fast mode
    note right of HALF_OPEN : Testing recovery
```

#### 3. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
- **BaseApiService**: Abstract base with throttling, caching, retries
- **Specialized Services**: MelCloudApi, TibberApi, WeatherApi
- **Business Services**: Optimizer, ThermalModelService, COPHelper
- **Utilities**: Logger, ErrorHandler, CircuitBreaker

### Scalability & Performance Considerations

#### ✅ **Strengths**
- **Memory Efficient**: <100MB peak usage with aggressive cleanup
- **Resilient Design**: Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute TTL reduces API calls
- **Throttling**: 2-second minimum between API calls
- **Background Processing**: Hourly/weekly cron jobs

#### ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**
- **Single Point of Failure**: Centralized app instance
- **No Horizontal Scaling**: Designed for single Homey device
- **Limited Caching**: No persistent cache across restarts
- **API Rate Limits**: Could benefit from more sophisticated throttling

### Security Architecture

#### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: All optimization calculations performed locally
- **Encrypted Storage**: API credentials stored in Homey's secure settings
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only operational data retained
- **No External Dependencies**: No third-party analytics or tracking
