# Migration handoff — API port (summary)

Purpose
-------
This document summarizes the work done to re-create a safe compatibility shim (`api.js`) and start the TypeScript port of the runtime API into `src/api.ts`. It explains what was changed, how it was verified, and exactly what the next developer needs to do to continue the migration.

What I did (high level)
-----------------------
- Recreated a minimal compatibility shim at the repository root: `api.js`.
  - The shim prefers compiled outputs (including `.homeybuild/api.js`) and falls back to `api.legacy.js`.
  - It exposes a small `__test` helper with `setServices`, `resetAll`, `setHistoricalData` and `_state` to support existing Jest tests.
  - It ensures top-level methods such as `getDeviceList`, `getRunHourlyOptimizer`, `getRunWeeklyCalibration` exist so tests and runtime code that require `./api.js` keep working.
- Ported initial API endpoints into `src/api.ts` (TypeScript):
  - `getDeviceList` (formatted devices + buildings)
  - `getRunHourlyOptimizer` (delegates to optimizer service)
  - `getRunWeeklyCalibration` (checks historical data count and delegates)
  - Also ported the higher-level admin endpoints from the compiled `.homeybuild/src/api.js`:
    - `runHourlyOptimizer`
    - `runWeeklyCalibration`
    - `getMemoryUsage`
    - `runThermalDataCleanup`
    - `resetHotWaterPatterns`
    - `clearHotWaterData`
- Added `MIGRATION_API_PORT.md` (developer-facing notes) and this summary file.
- Verified: ran `tsc --noEmit` and full Jest suite locally; all tests passed.

Files changed / added
---------------------
- Added/updated: `api.js` (repo root) — minimal compatibility shim and test helpers.
- Added/updated: `src/api.ts` — TypeScript port of several endpoints (initial subset).
- Added: `MIGRATION_API_PORT.md` — migration notes and next steps.
- Added: `MIGRATION_API_PORT_SUMMARY.md` (this file) — concise handoff summary for the next developer.

Why this approach
------------------
Keeping a small runtime shim while porting step-by-step keeps the repo testable and avoids a big-bang migration. The shim preserves the external contract (`require('./api.js')` returning top-level functions and a `__test` helper) while allowing `src/api.ts` to become the single source of truth for new/ported behavior.

How to run & verify locally
----------------------------
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Type-check only (no emit):

```bash
npm run tsc -- --noEmit
```

3. Run tests (jest):

```bash
npm test
```

Notes: tests run in Node on macOS zsh shell. The repository contains compiled artifacts in `.homeybuild/` — the shim prefers those if present.

Contract & minimal expectations
-------------------------------
- `require('./api.js')` must export top-level functions used by the codebase and tests (examples: `getDeviceList`, `getRunHourlyOptimizer`, `getRunWeeklyCalibration`, etc.).
- `require('./api.js').__test` must expose `setServices(services)`, `resetAll()`, `setHistoricalData(data)` and `_state` so unit tests can inject mocks.
- New TypeScript `src/api.ts` should be wired into the runtime by replacing the shim with the compiled output once the port is complete.

What I didn't do / assumptions made
----------------------------------
- I did not fully wire the `HeatOptimizerApp` to guarantee `.melCloud`, `.optimizer`, and `.historicalData` are present on `this` for every environment — I relied on test injection via `__test` or global fallbacks.
- I assumed services like `optimizer` and `melCloud` are accessible via `this.app.optimizer` or the `global` object in test runs. The next developer should ensure `src/app.ts` attaches actual service instances to `this` when initializing.

Next steps for the developer (recommended order)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Wire services to the app instance (high priority)
   - Ensure `HeatOptimizerApp` sets `this.melCloud`, `this.optimizer` and `this.historicalData` during `onInit` (or via `initializeServices`) so the TypeScript API uses app-scoped services rather than globals.
2. Continue porting endpoints incrementally (medium priority)
   - Use `.homeybuild/src/api.js` as the authoritative list of endpoints and port them into `src/api.ts` one-by-one.
   - Add unit tests for each newly ported endpoint (happy path + at least one error path).
3. Improve typing and interfaces (low/medium)
   - Add or refine TypeScript types for the API request/response shapes and for injected services.
4. Remove shim and compile
   - Once all endpoints are ported and tests green, remove/retire the runtime `api.js` shim and let the build produce the final `api.js` in the package root (or adjust build to copy compiled `src/api.js` into root).

Helpful references inside repo
-----------------------------
- Compiled reference API: `.homeybuild/src/api.js` (full list of methods and implementation details).
- Legacy fallback: `api.legacy.js` (kept as a backup in the shim).
- Current port: `src/api.ts` — where new TypeScript methods live.
- Tests: `test/unit` and `test/integration` show how the API is used and which functions must be present.

Acceptance checklist the new developer can use
----------------------------------------------
- [ ] `npm ci` completes with no fatal errors
- [ ] `npm run tsc -- --noEmit` reports no errors
- [ ] `npm test` (jest) passes all tests
- [ ] `require('./api.js').__test` has the injection helpers used by tests
- [ ] All endpoints used by the UI and integration tests are ported into `src/api.ts`
- [ ] `HeatOptimizerApp` exposes required service instances on `this`

Contact notes
-------------
If you need me to continue porting, tell me which endpoint or which test you want me to prioritize next and I will continue.
