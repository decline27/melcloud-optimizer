- **Price-Based Control**: Increases temperature during cheap hours and decreases during expensive hours
- **Advanced Thermal Learning Model**: Uses a data-driven thermal model that adapts to your home's specific characteristics
- **Weather Integration**: Incorporates weather data to adjust temperature based on outdoor conditions
- **Data Persistence**: Thermal model data persists across app reinstallations, ensuring continuous learning
- **Hot Water Tank Control**: Optimizes hot water tank temperature based on electricity prices
- **Comfort Profile**: Adjusts temperature based on time of day and sleep patterns
- **Notifications**: Keeps you informed about temperature changes and price levels
- **Manual Triggers**: Buttons in the settings page to manually trigger hourly optimization and weekly calibration for testing
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logs in the terminal for debugging and monitoring
- **API Integration**: Exposes API endpoints for integration with other apps and services

## Requirements

- Homey Pro (SDK 3.0 compatible)
- Mitsubishi Electric heat pump connected to MELCloud
- MELCloud account credentials
- Tibber account with API token

## Installation

1. Install the app from the Homey App Store
2. Configure your credentials in the app settings:
   - MELCloud email and password
   - Tibber API token
3. Configure temperature settings:
   - Minimum temperature (default: 19Â°C)
   - Maximum temperature (default: 21Â°C)
   - Maximum temperature step (default: 1Â°C)
   - Initial K factor (default: 0.5)

## How It Works

The app runs on two schedules:

1. **Hourly Optimization** (every hour at minute 5):
   - Fetches current electricity prices from Tibber
   - Determines the price level (VERY_CHEAP, CHEAP, NORMAL, EXPENSIVE, VERY_EXPENSIVE)
   - Retrieves weather data for your location
   - Reads the current indoor and outdoor temperatures from MELCloud
   - Applies comfort profile adjustments based on time of day
   - Calculates a new target temperature based on price level, weather, and thermal model
   - Optimizes hot water tank temperature if enabled
   - Stores the data in the thermal learning model
   - Logs the data for future analysis and creates timeline entries

2. **Weekly Calibration** (Sunday at 2:05 AM):
   - Analyzes the past week's temperature and price data using the thermal learning model
   - Calculates the relationship between temperature changes and price changes
   - Updates the thermal model's K-factor based on actual observed data
   - Improves future optimization accuracy
   - Persists the thermal model data to survive app reinstallations

## Logging and Timeline

The app provides comprehensive logging through multiple channels:

### Terminal Logging

The app logs detailed information to both the Homey logs and the terminal:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed diagnostic information
- **INFO**: General operational information
- **WARN**: Warning messages that don't prevent operation
- **ERROR**: Error messages that may affect operation
- **NOTIFICATION**: User notifications
- **TIMELINE**: Timeline entries
- **THERMAL MODEL**: Data about the thermal learning model
- **MARKERS**: Special markers for important events

All logs are visible in the terminal when running the app with `homey app run`.

To view these logs, run the app with:
```bash
homey app run
```

The app also logs special markers for important events:
```
===== HOURLY OPTIMIZATION STARTED =====
===== HOURLY OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY =====
===== WEEKLY CALIBRATION STARTED =====
===== WEEKLY CALIBRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY =====
===== THERMAL MODEL DATA =====
```

### Timeline Entries

The app creates detailed timeline entries in the Homey app for key events:

- **Hourly Optimization**: Shows price level, indoor temperature, target temperatures, K-factor, and weather adjustments
- **Weekly Calibration**: Shows previous and new K-factor, analysis of temperature/price relationship, and number of data points
- **Manual Triggers**: Records when manual operations are triggered from the settings page
- **Tank Temperature**: Shows hot water tank temperature adjustments based on price levels

### Thermal Model Data Viewer

The app includes a "View Thermal Model Data" button in the settings page that shows:

- Number of optimization data points collected
- Current K-factor value
- Last calibration details (timestamp, K-factor change, analysis)
- Last optimization details (temperatures, price)
- Recent data points with timestamps

This helps you understand how the thermal learning model is adapting to your home's specific characteristics over time.

### Hot Water Usage Pattern Viewer

The app includes hot water usage pattern visualization in the settings page that shows:

- Usage patterns by hour of day (0-23)
- Usage patterns by day of week (Sunday-Saturday)
- Confidence level in the learned patterns
- Predictions for the next 24 hours
- Memory usage statistics
- Data retention information

This helps you understand your household's hot water usage patterns and how the system is optimizing tank temperature based on these patterns.

## Troubleshooting

If the app isn't working as expected:

1. Check the app logs for error messages
2. Verify your MELCloud and Tibber credentials
3. Make sure your heat pump is online and accessible via MELCloud
4. Check that your Tibber subscription is active and providing price data
5. Use the "View Thermal Model Data" button to check if data is being collected
6. Use the "Manage Scheduled Jobs" button to ensure the cron jobs are running
7. Run the app in development mode to see detailed console logs

### Common Issues

- **Device ID or Building ID Reset**: If you notice these settings reset when opening the settings page, use the "Get Device List" button to automatically detect and set the correct values
- **No Temperature Changes**: Check your min/max temperature settings - if they're too close together, there won't be much room for optimization
- **Thermal Model Not Learning**: Make sure you have at least 24 hours of data collection before expecting significant learning

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/decline27/melcloud-optimizer/issues).

## Privacy

This app stores your MELCloud and Tibber credentials locally on your Homey. No data is shared with third parties except when making API calls to the respective services. The thermal model data is stored locally on your Homey and is not shared with any external services.
