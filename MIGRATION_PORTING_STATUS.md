# Migration / Porting Status — TypeScript API port

Date: 2025-08-23
Branch: cleanup/ci-eslint-legacymap
Author: automated assistant (updated by developer)

## High level summary

This repository is in the middle of a TypeScript port from the legacy runtime API to a ported `src/api.ts` implementation that aims to replace the old `api.js` shim.
The port focuses on preserving runtime compatibility while removing writes to Node `global.*` where possible and providing a small compatibility shim for tests and legacy callsites.

## What was changed (key files)

- `src/api.ts`
  - Ported many legacy endpoints into a TypeScript `Api` class and exported top-level wrapper functions.
  - Added `initializeServices(services?: any)` helper to accept injected services from the app runtime.
  - Implemented `__test` compatibility helpers with an internal `_state` (setServices, setHistoricalData, resetAll, getState).
  - To keep tests intact, `__test.setServices` mirrors provided services to legacy `global.*` while preserving the internal `_state` (short-term compatibility).
  - `__test.getState()` returns a legacy-shaped object ({ melCloud, tibber, optimizer, historicalData, _state }) without implicitly writing to globals.

- `src/app.ts`
  - App wiring updated to call `api.initializeServices(...)` after constructing runtime services (app now supports service injection). A few previous `global.*` writes were commented/removed in favor of the injection path.

- `src/services/melcloud-api.ts`
  - Defensive change in `ensureConnected()` to avoid scheduling background reconnect timers when tests are running (detects `process.env.JEST_WORKER_ID`). This prevents test flakiness from background network calls.
  - Network call handling is centralized; tests mock `https` in unit tests to avoid real network calls.

- Runtime shim files (`api.js`, `.homeybuild/api.js`) have been reduced to a thin wrapper that prefers the ported implementation and forwards `__test` where needed (note: developer may have edited `.homeybuild/api.js` manually — check before publishing).

## Current behavior & compatibility notes

- Backwards compatibility: The module still exposes `module.exports.__test` (CommonJS) so legacy code and tests can access test helpers.
- Tests that expected services on `global.*` are satisfied because `__test.setServices` mirrors service objects into `global.*` for now. This is a transitional measure to keep the test-suite green while migrating callsites.
- The long-term plan is to stop mirroring into `global.*` and update modules to use injected services on the `app` object.

## Tests & CI status

- TypeScript compile (`npx tsc --noEmit`) passes on the branch after the last edits.
- Jest unit + integration tests were executed locally. Most suites pass; previously-observed intermittent 401 Unauthorized failures caused by background reconnect timers were mitigated by skipping reconnect timers in test env. Some tests use real MELCloud credentials and are gated by `test/config.json` or `REAL_MELCLOUD=1`.

To run the test suite locally (fast):

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand
# or for debugging with async handle detection
npx jest --runInBand --detectOpenHandles --verbose --coverage=false
```

If you have a valid `test/config.json` and want to run real MELCloud integration tests, set the env var or provide the file. Keep in mind these depend on external credentials and can produce 401s if creds are invalid.

## Next steps (prioritized) — what a developer should do next

1. Migrate one service at a time off `global.*` and onto injected app-scoped services.
   - Highest impact targets: `src/services/cop-helper.ts`, `src/services/optimizer.ts`, `src/services/thermal-model/*`.
   - Strategy: update constructor signature to accept a `services` object (or explicit `melCloud`, `tibber`, `logger` params) and prefer `this.melCloud` (or `this.services.melCloud`) over `(global as any).melCloud`.
   - Add unit tests for the modified constructor using dependency injection to verify behavior.

2. Remove temporary global mirroring from `__test.setServices` once a majority of callsites have been migrated. Update `__test.getState()` to be the single source for legacy read access if needed.

3. Update runtime shim (`api.js` / `.homeybuild/api.js`) to import the ported `src/api.ts` (compiled) and forward `__test` for any remaining legacy consumers. Keep the shim minimal and documented.

4. CI: separate real-network integration tests into a dedicated job that runs only when credentials are provided (use repository secrets and `REAL_MELCLOUD=1`). Keep unit tests fully mocked.

5. Clean-up and docs:
   - Remove `api-old-version.js` and other legacy copies when migration is complete.
   - Add a migration guide for maintainers describing how to update service consumers to use injected services.

## Concrete task for you to pick next (I can implement)

- Option A (recommended next immediate task): Migrate `src/services/cop-helper.ts` to accept an injected `melCloud` and `logger` in its constructor, update all call sites to pass `app.melCloud` (or `api.__test._state.services.melCloud` in tests), and add/update unit tests to exercise both injected and fallback cases.

- Option B: Start a sweep that replaces all reads of `(global as any).melCloud` with `this.app.melCloud || (global as any).melCloud` across prioritized modules — smaller, safer commits per module.

Tell me which option you prefer and I will implement it and run tests.

## Quick checklist (status)

- [x] Port core endpoints to `src/api.ts` and provide Api class + wrappers
- [x] Add `initializeServices` to allow injection from `src/app.ts`
- [x] Provide `__test` helpers and keep legacy-shaped `getState()` (option A implemented)
- [x] Keep unit tests green by mirroring services into `global.*` via `__test.setServices` (temporary)
- [x] Prevent background reconnect timers during Jest runs to avoid flaky network calls
- [ ] Migrate all service modules off `global.*` (many callsites remain)
- [ ] Remove global mirroring and shrink compatibility shim (final cleanup)
- [ ] Move real-network tests to dedicated CI job with proper gating and secrets

## How to validate locally

1. Run typecheck:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

2. Run unit tests (fast):

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand
```

3. If you want to run only a specific test during a migration, add `-t` with the test name, or run the test file directly:

```bash
npx jest test/unit/cop-helper.test.ts -i -t "your test name"
```

## Notes / assumptions

- The current approach intentionally keeps a short compatibility layer so tests and legacy runtime code are not broken during incremental porting.
- The repository contains modules that still assume `global.*`; migration will be iterative and should be done in small, test-covered commits.
- Developer has recently made manual edits to `.homeybuild/api.js`; check that file before building/publishing the runtime shim.

---
If you want, I can start implementing the recommended Option A (migrate `cop-helper`) now and run the tests — confirm and I will proceed. If you'd prefer a different next step, tell me which.
