## Migration Guide

### For Users Upgrading from 12.x

The upgrade to 12.5.5 is seamless - no configuration changes required. The app will automatically:
- Migrate existing settings
- Preserve thermal learning data
- Maintain optimization schedules
- Continue normal operation

### For Developers

If you've been working with the JavaScript codebase:
1. All source files are now in TypeScript under `src/`
2. Build process now requires TypeScript compilation
3. Test files have been updated for TypeScript compatibility
4. API structure remains the same for backward compatibility
