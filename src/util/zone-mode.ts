/**
 * Zone control-mode helpers for Mitsubishi ATW (air-to-water) devices.
 *
 * MELCloud reports the zone control mode in `OperationModeZone1` / `OperationModeZone2`.
 * The meaning of the zone setpoint depends entirely on this mode:
 *
 *  - 0 Room   — the unit modulates flow temperature to reach `SetTemperatureZoneN`.
 *  - 1 Flow   — the unit holds a fixed flow temperature (`SetHeatFlowTemperatureZoneN`).
 *  - 2 Curve  — the unit follows its weather-compensation curve for flow temperature.
 *
 * `SetTemperatureZoneN` is a room temperature in every mode. With a room sensor fitted it acts as
 * a thermostat even in Curve mode: room at or above the setpoint means thermo-off, below means
 * the curve runs (measured live 2026-10-13: a raise above the room switched an idle unit to
 * heating within one poll). What Curve mode removes is *power*: a higher setpoint cannot make
 * the curve deliver more heat, so (target - indoor) says whether heat flows, not how fast. Any
 * model that learns a heating rate from that difference is only valid in Room mode.
 *
 * (The nonsense 29 °C "room target" seen in August came from reading the ATA-shaped
 * `SetTemperature` field, not from the zone mode.)
